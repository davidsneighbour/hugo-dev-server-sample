# DNB GoHugo Component / Dev-Server Sample

Sample Repo with a development server for GoHugo Modules

Having a development server for GoHugo modules in their respective repository often leads to issues with module configuration and development server configuration "seeping" through to the project using that module.

It might also be good to have the development server in a folder that can be ignored when packaging anything.

Work in progress, working now, but immature still.

## ToDo

- have sensible defaults for the .env variables
- add some linting
- add install/update script
- documentation
- better layouts
- whatever comes up
